## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `SyscallCounter` to `ExecutionResources`

### Removed

- `FunctionName::from_sierra_statement_idx` as it was mixing concepts. `FunctionName` should represent a function name
  in
  annotations, while this method was creating a function name from a sierra program.
- functions related to adding, subtracting, and comparison of resources. Due to ambiguity in the meaning of these
  operations, they were removed. Use `ExecutionResources` directly for resource management.

### Changed

- `ClassHash`, `ContractAddress`, and `EntryPointSelector` underling type is now `starknet_types_core::felt::Felt`
  instead of `String` for more standardized handling of these types.

## [0.3.1] - 2025-03-04

### Added

- optional `gas_consumed` field in `ExecutionResources` struct, to allow tracking sierra gas

## [0.3.0] - 2025-02-25

### Added
